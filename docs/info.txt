https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three

12/10/24:
1.add basic policy for request processing in ElevatorManager.
2.add status field to Request struct (make atomic / add some sort of race condition solution)
3.add to elevator class a ds for keeping track of requests he takes care of / clients (requests) via reference/pointer 
4.add logic: only once a request entry_level is reached by a certain elevator a 
  ,then the dest_floor of that request would be added to the requests of elevator a.
5.revise rule of 5/3 and implement.
